Verified functionality against multiple PDB structures. All tests passing (12/12).
All documentation complete and accurate. Ready for portfolio presentation.

Final state includes: 15 assignment traces removed, 2 files renamed
(assignment1_template.py → pdb_parser.py, test_assignment1.py → test_pdb_parser.py),
