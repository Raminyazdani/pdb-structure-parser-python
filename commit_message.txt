Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(spatial): Implement spatial metrics and distance calculations

Added 3D spatial analysis capabilities with distance_calculator() for Euclidean
distance computation and most_distant_residue_finder() for identifying the
most distant residue pair. Uses CA (alpha carbon) atoms as representative
points for each residue. Performs pairwise distance calculation (O(n²)) to
find maximum separation.

Returns maximum distance and residue pair information. Typical protein diameters
range 30-100 Å. This metric is useful for understanding protein size and shape.
Verified calculations against known protein dimensions and validated Euclidean
distance formula implementation.
