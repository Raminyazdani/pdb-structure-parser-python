Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(analysis): Implement atomic composition calculators

Added element-level composition analysis with atomic_composition_calculator()
and atomic_composition_percentage_calculator(). Parses 'element' field from
PDB ATOM lines to count C, N, O, S and other elements. Provides sorted output
by frequency for clear reporting.

Returns data like {'C': 1450, 'N': 385, 'O': 421, 'S': 12} providing deeper
structural insight than amino acid composition alone. Percentage calculator
adds normalized distribution data. Verified atomic counts match expected
ratios for protein structures. Tested with multiple PDB files.
