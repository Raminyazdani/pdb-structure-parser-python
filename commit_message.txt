Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(setup): Initial project structure and README

Established the foundational project structure for the PDB Structure Parser.
Created repository with essential infrastructure including Python .gitignore,
requirements.txt with pytest dependency, and professional .github templates
for issues and copilot instructions. Added initial README with project overview.

This commit provides a clean foundation with no code yet, just the necessary
infrastructure to support professional Python development and testing workflows.
Verified the structure is ready for implementing the PDB parser functionality.
