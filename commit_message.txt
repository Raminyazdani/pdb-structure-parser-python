Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(analysis): Implement amino acid composition calculator

Added amino_acid_composition_calculator() method for analyzing residue
composition in protein structures. Properly handles residue deduplication
using (chain, res_seq, res_name) tuples to ensure each residue is counted
only once (not per-atom). Returns sorted output by frequency (descending)
for better readability.

Uses set-based tracking to prevent double-counting of residues. Output
format is a dictionary like {'GLY': 42, 'LEU': 28, ...} providing clear
composition data. Verified accuracy with multiple test PDB structures.
