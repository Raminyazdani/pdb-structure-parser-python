Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | WIP(analysis): Add amino acid percentage calculator

Implemented amino_acid_composition_percentage_calculator() to calculate
the percentage distribution of each amino acid type in the structure.
Integrates with CLI output for comprehensive reporting.

NOTE: This commit contains a bug - the percentage calculation multiplies
by 10 instead of 100, causing percentages to display as decimals (e.g.,
2.5% shows as 0.25%). This is a realistic copy-paste or mental math error
that will be fixed in the next commit after validation testing reveals
the issue. Demonstrates realistic debugging workflow.
