Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(parser): Add core PDB file parser and data extraction

Implemented the RaminCalc class with core PDB file parsing capabilities.
Added pdb_file_reader() method that parses ATOM lines following the PDB
fixed-width format specification. Parser extracts coordinates (x, y, z),
residue information, chain identifiers, and atom names from columns per
standard PDB format (0-6 record, 6-11 serial, 12-16 atom name, etc.).

Returns data as a list of dictionaries for easy downstream analysis.
Includes error handling for file not found scenarios. Verified parsing
works correctly with standard PDB format files from RCSB.
