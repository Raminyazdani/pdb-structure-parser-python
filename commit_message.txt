Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(test): Add comprehensive test suite with pytest

Created complete test_pdb_parser.py with 12 comprehensive tests covering all
parser functions. Used pytest fixtures for clean test PDB data. Mock PDB data
embedded in tests prevents external dependencies. Tests cover: PDB parsing,
amino acid composition and percentages, atomic composition and percentages,
hydrophobicity (counts and percentages), charge analysis, heteroatom parsing
and counting, distance calculations, and radius of gyration.

All 12 tests passing. Validates edge cases and ensures accuracy across all
calculators. Test data is realistic and representative of actual PDB structures.
This ensures code quality and prevents regressions. Verified test suite runs
successfully with pytest -v.
