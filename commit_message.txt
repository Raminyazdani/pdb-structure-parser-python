Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(cli): Add main print function and CLI support

Integrated all analysis functions into unified print_function() for comprehensive
output. Added command-line argument support via sys.argv for production usage.
Created complete analysis pipeline with user-friendly formatting including section
headers and clear separators. Single function orchestrates entire workflow.

Usage: python pdb_parser.py <pdb_file>
Displays error message if no file provided. Formatted output presents all metrics
(composition, percentages, hydrophobicity, charge, atomic stats, heteroatoms,
spatial metrics) in organized sections. Verified CLI works correctly with various
PDB files and handles edge cases gracefully.
