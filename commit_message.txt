Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(docs): Enhance README and add portfolio documentation

Expanded README with detailed usage instructions, comprehensive documentation
of inputs and outputs, troubleshooting section, and reproducibility notes.
Added portfolio documentation files: project_identity.md (professional identity),
suggestion.txt (issues ledger), suggestions_done.txt (changes ledger),
report.md (transformation report), and results.txt (example output).

README now aligned with project_identity.md professional branding. All assignment
traces removed and replaced with professional naming. Includes clear setup steps,
data source information, and complete feature descriptions. Documentation is
portfolio-ready for professional presentation. Verified all instructions work
as documented.
