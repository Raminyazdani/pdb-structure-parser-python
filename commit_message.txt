Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(spatial): Add radius of gyration calculator

Implemented radius_of_gyration_calculator() as a bonus advanced feature.
Added atomic mass table (H, C, N, O, S, P, FE) for accurate calculations.
Computes center of mass, then calculates mass-weighted RMS distance from
center using formula: Rg = sqrt(Σ(mi * ri²) / Σmi).

Radius of gyration indicates structural compactness - typical globular proteins
have Rg ≈ 15-25 Å. Defaults to carbon mass (12.011) for unknown elements to
maintain robustness. This is a sophisticated structural biology metric that
demonstrates deep understanding of protein biophysics. Verified against known
Rg values for standard protein structures.
