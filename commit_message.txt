Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(analysis): Add hydrophobicity composition calculator

Integrated Kyte-Doolittle hydrophobicity scale for amino acid classification.
Implemented amino_acid_hydrophobicity_composition_calculator() that classifies
residues as hydrophobic (positive scale values) or hydrophilic (negative values).
Scale ranges from -4.5 (most hydrophilic) to +4.5 (most hydrophobic).

Uses established Kyte-Doolittle scale from 1982 biophysics literature.
Returns counts like {'hydrophobic': 120, 'hydrophilic': 98} which is
important for protein structure/function analysis. Verified classification
accuracy against known hydrophobicity data.
