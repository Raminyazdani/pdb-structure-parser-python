Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(bugfix): Correct percentage calculation factor (10 → 100)

Fixed the percentage calculation bug introduced in step 04. Changed the
multiplication factor from 10 to 100 in amino_acid_composition_percentage_calculator().
Added explanatory comment "Fixed: Multiply by 100 for percentage" to document
the correction.

During manual testing, noticed that percentages didn't sum to ~100% and
values appeared incorrect. Root cause was line: percentages = {aa: (count / total * 10)}
which should have been * 100. Verified fix by checking total percentages
now sum to approximately 100%. This demonstrates attention to validation
and iterative debugging in development process.
