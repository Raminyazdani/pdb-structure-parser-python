Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(parser): Add heteroatom identification and counting

Implemented hetero_atom_pdb_reader() for parsing HETATM lines and
hetero_atom_residue_counter() for counting non-protein atoms. HETATM
lines indicate ligands, cofactors, and metal ions separate from standard
protein residues. Explicitly excludes HOH (water) molecules as per
bioinformatics convention.

Important for identifying bound molecules that may be functionally relevant
like cofactors, substrates, or inhibitors. Returns dictionary of heteroatom
residue counts. Verified HETATM parsing against multiple PDB structures
containing various ligands and cofactors.
