Ramin Yazdani | PDB Structure Parser | main | feat(analysis): Add charge composition analysis

Added amino_acid_charge_composition_calculator() for electrostatic analysis.
Identifies and counts positive residues (LYS, ARG, HIS) and negative residues
(ASP, GLU). Returns dictionary like {'positive': 45, 'negative': 38} which
is crucial for understanding protein electrostatic properties.

This complements the hydrophobicity analysis from step 06 and provides
deeper insight into protein characteristics. Important for predicting
protein behavior in different pH environments and protein-protein interactions.
Verified charge assignments match biochemical standards.
